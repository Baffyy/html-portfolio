<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Aha yes, this is not your conventional portfolio page. My name is Baffour Kwabena Gyimah, a 27 year old who is meaning to switch careers. Yes, nyou heard me right. I studied environmental management at my bachelors and I also hold a Masters degree in that too. </p>

<p>Why the switch? You may ask. I just needed a change bevcuase i felt stagnant in my career and I have always had a passion for tech. This fresh air from my stale career would go a long way for me.<p>

<p>What is my stack? Well now, I am just versed in HTML and CSS. But watch this space, there is so much more to come.
